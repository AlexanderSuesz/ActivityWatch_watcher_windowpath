# ActivityWatch_watcher_windowpath
A simple ActivityWatch module similar to the aw_watcher_window module, but instead of saving just the program name, it saves the full program path.
It is currently built for Windows machines and designed to run locally together with a local ActivityWatch instance. Just set this script to automatically start on startup.
